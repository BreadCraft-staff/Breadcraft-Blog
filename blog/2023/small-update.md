Hey guys! I just wanted to write out this post to let you all know what is happening here at Breadcraft, and I am pleased to let you all know that over the next two weeks I should be hopefully bringing the original servers back online again, so I hope you all will be excited for the return for the Survival, Lobby and lots of other things :)

In other things over the next few weeks you might see some things happen with some of the sites and everything related to our branding, most noteably the logo as I am starting the process of changing to our new logo for all of our stuff and there are over exciting changes happening so I hope you will enjoy these changes as much as I am.

That is all for this time thanks for reading,
